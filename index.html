    <h2>The Gospel Is for All</h2>
    <p>The message of Jesus is for everyone. The Bible says:</p>
    <p class="verse">"God loved the world so much that He gave His only Son, so anyone who believes in Him will not be lost but will have eternal life." – John 3:16</p>

    <h2>What Is Implicit Exclusivity?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, people feel left out from church or Christian groups even when nobody says it clearly. This happens when we have silent rules about how someone should dress, talk, or behave before we accept them.</p>
    <p>This is called <strong>implicit exclusivity</strong> — it's when we make others feel unwelcome without saying it openly.</p>

    <h2>Jesus Welcomed Everyone</h2>
    <p>Jesus showed love to everyone, even those that others rejected:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The woman at the well (John 4)</li>
      <li>Zacchaeus, the tax collector (Luke 19)</li>
      <li>The thief on the cross (Luke 23:42-43)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>He never asked them to be perfect first — He loved them and gave them hope.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Be Like Jesus</h2>
    <p>If we say "everyone is welcome," let’s show it in real life. Let’s accept people even if they’re new, poor, different, or don’t know the Bible well yet.</p>
    <p class="verse">"Accept one another, just as Christ accepted you." – Romans 15:7</p>
